# 🌦️ Real-Time Weather Dashboard using Power BI

This project showcases a real-time weather dashboard built in **Power BI**, using live data fetched from a **Weather API**.

---
## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Power BI** to visualize **real-time weather data** by connecting to a live weather API via the web connector.

The dataset includes key atmospheric metrics such as:
- **Temperature (°C)**
- **Humidity (%)**
- **Wind Speed (km/h)**
- **Pressure (hPa)**
- **Visibility (km)**
- **Cloud Cover (%)**
- **Weather Description** (e.g., Clear, Rainy, Cloudy)

The dashboard connects to a live API and can be refreshed to display the most recent weather conditions automatically.  
It monitors **real-time weather in 6 selected Indian cities**, making it valuable for localized weather tracking.

> **Cities included**: Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Lucknow, Ajmer, and Noida.

This dashboard is particularly useful for industries such as **travel, agriculture, logistics**, and **city planning**, where real-time weather insights are crucial for operations and decision-making.
